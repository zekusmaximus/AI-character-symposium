# AI Character Council - Prototype Documentation

## Overview
AI Character Council is a cross-platform desktop application designed for speculative fiction authors to manage complex characters across multiple novels. This prototype demonstrates the core functionality of the application, including character management, AI-powered conversations, and secure API integration.

## Features Implemented

### Character Management
- Character creation with detailed personality traits, values, and voice patterns
- Character visualization and editing
- Memory system for character experiences and knowledge

### AI Character Engine
- Natural language conversations with AI-powered characters
- Persistent memory system for characters to remember past interactions
- Secure API key management for cloud-based LLMs (OpenAI/GPT-4, Anthropic/Claude)
- Local model fallback for offline functionality

### Timeline Management
- Basic timeline interface (placeholder)
- Character-event linking

### Creative Writing Utilities
- Note system with tagging (placeholder)
- Project organization

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- Cross-platform desktop application using Electron.js
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Database: SQLite with Prisma ORM for local data storage
- AI Integration: Hybrid approach with local embedding models and cloud-based LLMs

### Security Features
- Secure API key storage with encryption
- Local data storage for privacy
- Offline functionality for core features

## Running the Prototype

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Generate Prisma client:
   ```
   npx prisma generate
   ```
4. Start the application in development mode:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Configuration
- API keys can be configured in the Settings page
- The application works offline with limited functionality if no API keys are provided

## Future Development
- Enhanced character evolution based on experiences
- Character roundtables (conversations between multiple AI characters)
- Advanced visualization tools for character relationships and arcs
- Export features for Word, Obsidian, and Scrivener
- Comprehensive tagging system for themes, symbols, and plot elements

## Known Limitations
- This prototype focuses on core functionality and user experience
- Some features are simulated for demonstration purposes
- Production deployment would require additional security hardening
- Local AI models would need to be optimized for performance

## Feedback and Next Steps
We welcome your feedback on this prototype. Future development will focus on enhancing the AI character engine, improving the user interface, and adding more advanced writing tools based on your input.
